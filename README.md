# Niphidium-Integrative
This repository brings together integrative analyses applied to the genus Niphidium (Polypodiaceae), combining near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, Fourier ellipse (EFA) contour analysis, and linear morphometrics. We test species delimitation hypotheses based on the classic morphological descriptions of Lellinger (1979) and plastid inference.
